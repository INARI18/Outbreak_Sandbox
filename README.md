# Outbreak Sandbox

> Experimental malware propagation and cyber defense simulator assisted by Artificial Intelligence.

**Outbreak Sandbox** is an interactive graphical platform that allows you to simulate, visualize, and interact with complex network topologies where digital viruses spread guided by LLMs.

**Note:** This system was not designed for advanced security analysis, real audits, or rigorous academic research. The goal is purely experimental: to provide a visual environment to observe how a language model interacts with graph theory concepts and infection strategies in a controlled scenario.

## 🧠 AI Integration (Groq)

This project uses the **Groq** API to provide the virus "brain", allowing it to take decisions based on the current network state.

### API Key Configuration

To use the real AI, you need a Groq account (the free plan works) to get an access key.

1.  Create an account at [Groq Cloud](https://console.groq.com/).
2.  Generate an API Key in the console.
3.  **In the App:** When starting Outbreak Sandbox, click the **"API Key"** button on the home screen and paste your key.
4.  **Alternatively (.env):** You can create a `.env` file in the project root with the content `GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key`.

If no key is configured, the system will automatically use a **Mock Client**. In this mode, the virus decisions will be random, with no AI reasoning, but ensuring the application works for interface testing.

## 🏗️ Simulation Core

### Simulation Engine

The `SimulationEngine` orchestrates time (steps) and checks stop conditions.

#### Execution Flow

1.  **Stop Check:** Checks if everyone is infected or time has run out.
2.  **AI Query:** Sends the current network state to the LLM interface.
3.  **Decision:** Receives instruction on which node to infect and which strategy to use.
4.  **Propagation:** Calculates success based on virus attributes vs. node security.
5.  **Visualization:** The UI is updated in real-time.

### Data Structure

#### Virus (`models/virus.py`)

Possesses attributes that determine its success:

```python
class VirusCharacteristics:
    attack_power: float    # Brute force (0.0 to 10.0)
    stealth: float         # Ability to hide
    spread_rate: float     # Propagation speed
    mutation_rate: float   # Chance to alter its statistics
    behavior: str          # Profile (e.g., "Aggressive", "Stealthy")
```

#### Network Node (`models/node.py`)

Represents devices (PC, Server, IoT):

```python
class Node:
    id: str
    type: str              # 'server', 'pc', 'iot', etc.
    security_level: float  # Defense against attacks
    status: str            # 'healthy', 'infected', 'quarantined'
```

## 📊 Propagation Mechanics

Propagation uses different attack strategies:

1.  **Exploit (Default):** Balanced between Attack and Defense. Medium detection chance.
2.  **Brute Force:** +50% attack, but ignores stealth. High detection chance.
3.  **Phishing (Social Engineering):** Focuses on stealth. Very effective against human nodes (PCs), less effective against servers.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step: Running a Simulation

1.  **Start:** Upon opening the app, navigate to the configuration screen.
2.  **Topology:** Choose the network shape (e.g., Mesh, Star, Grid) and the total number of nodes.
3.  **Virus:** Select a virus from the predefined list. Each malware has its own characteristics of aggressiveness and stealth.
4.  **Configuration:** Choose the simulation mode:
    - **Stochastic:** Probabilistic results (role-playing).
    - **Deterministic:** Fixed results based on a "Seed". Useful for replicating exact scenarios.
5.  **Execution:**
    - The main panel will display the network graph.
    - The simulation will automatically choose the first infected node.
    - Follow the AI decision log in the side panel while the infection visually spreads through the network.
