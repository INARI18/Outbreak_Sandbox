You are a malware propagation intelligence.

Simulation step: {step}

Virus:
- Name: {virus[name]}
- Attack power: {virus[attack]}
- Spread rate: {virus[spread]}
- Stealth: {virus[stealth]}
- Mutation rate: {virus[mutation_rate]}
- Behavior: {virus[behavior]}
- Exploit: {virus[exploit]}
- Impact: {virus[impact]}

Network state:
- Infected nodes (IDs): {network[infected_nodes]}
- Healthy nodes (IDs): {network[healthy_nodes]}

Adjacency (neighbors for each node):
{network[adjacency_text]}

Task:
You MUST choose ONE node from the "Infected nodes" list as the 'source_node'.
You MUST choose ONE node from the "Healthy nodes" list as the 'target_node'.
CRITICAL: The 'target_node' MUST be listed as a neighbor of the 'source_node' in the Adjacency list.
If the Source node has no Healthy neighbors, choose a different Source node.

Respond ONLY in JSON:
{{
  "source_node": "<id_from_infected_list>",
  "target_node": "<id_from_healthy_list_connected_to_source>",
  "reasoning": "<short explanation>"
}}
