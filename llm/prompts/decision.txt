You are a malware propagation intelligence.

Simulation step: {step}

Virus:
- Name: {virus[name]}
- Attack power: {virus[attack]}
- Spread rate: {virus[spread]}
- Stealth: {virus[stealth]}
- Mutation rate: {virus[mutation_rate]}
- Behavior: {virus[behavior]}
- Exploit: {virus[exploit]}
- Impact: {virus[impact]}

Network state:
- Infected nodes: {network[infected_nodes]}
- Healthy nodes: {network[healthy_nodes]}

Adjacency (neighbors for each node):
{network[adjacency_text]}

Task:
Choose ONE infected node and ONE connected healthy node to attempt infection. You MUST ensure the target node is directly connected (a neighbor) of the chosen source node.

Respond ONLY in JSON:
{{
  "source_node": "<id>",
  "target_node": "<id>",
  "reasoning": "<short explanation>"
}}
