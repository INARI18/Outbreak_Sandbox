The virus is evaluating its recent performance.

Current characteristics:
- Attack power: {virus[attack]}
- Spread rate: {virus[spread]}
- Stealth: {virus[stealth]}
- Mutation rate: {virus[mutation_rate]}
- Behavior: {virus[behavior]}

Metrics summary:
{metrics}

Recent attempts:
{recent_attempts}

Task:
Decide whether the virus should mutate based on recent failures.
If the virus is failing due to "incompatible_host", you SHOULD add a new target host (e.g. from 'pc' to 'iot').

Rules:
- Mutation is OPTIONAL
- If mutating, change ONE stat (Attack OR Speed OR Stealth) by a small amount (max ±2.0)
- OR add a new target host type if needed.
- Do NOT change everything at once.

Return ONLY valid JSON:

If no mutation:
{
  "mutate": false,
  "reason": "Current strategy is working fine."
}

If mutation:
{
  "mutate": true,
  "type": "stat_boost" | "adaptation",
  "target_parameter": "attack_power" | "spread_rate" | "stealth" | "target_hosts",
  "change_value": 0.5 (for stats) or "iot_device" (for adaptation),
  "reason": "Increasing attack to overcome high defense."
}
}

If mutation:
{
  "mutate": true,
  "changes": {
    "attack": <float>,
    "spread": <float>,
    "stealth": <float>
  },
  "reason": "<short explanation>"
}
